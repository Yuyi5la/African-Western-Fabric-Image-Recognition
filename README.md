# 🧠 African vs Western Fabric Image Recognition

This project is an image recognition system built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenCV**. The main objective is to classify and distinguish **African fabric patterns** from **Western fabric styles**, showcasing the visual uniqueness and cultural richness of each. It aims to contribute to a deeper appreciation of textile diversity through computer vision.

## 📁 Dataset Sources
